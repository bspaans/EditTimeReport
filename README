¡¡¡¡¡¡ work in progress !!!!!!!



EditTimeChart [think of name later]
-----------------------------------

  A tool aimed at programmers and other people who spend a lot of time in their 
  editor and need to keep track of what's been done over time.

  The idea:

  1. There is a permanently running daemon that logs commands to a file
  2. Scriptable editors contact the daemon on each save/close/whatever.
  3. We can produce nice graphs of our work, without having to do any manual work.
  4. ???
  5. PROFIT (literally!)



Current status » Daemon
-----------------------

  I have had a daemon running since begin december. It was written in Python 
  using the Twisted networking library. The daemon can not yet be found 
  in this repos, but will soon be once I clean up the files a bit.  

  The daemon logs to a flat plain text file in the following format:

   2009 12 29 10 39 23 1 363 EDIT /home/bspaans/src/file.hs
   YEAR MONTH DAY HOUR MIN SEC DOW DOY COMMAND FILE

  where DOW and DOW stand for the day of the week and year, 
  and where COMMAND is one of EDIT, START or STOP. 



Current status » Graphing
-------------------------

  The graphing program is currently under heavy development. It is written in 
  Haskell and makes use of the libraries in the Haskell Platform; no other 
  packages are needed. It can currently produce HTML pages, but will also 
  include a command line and interactive mode. 
  
  If you want to have a look at its current (pre-alpha) state, you can compile 
  the program manually with 
    ghc --make Html.hs 

  To produce a HTML report of the log file, you can then run:
    ./Html edittime.log 

  This is all subject to change though.
