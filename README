¡¡¡¡¡¡ work in progress !!!!!!!



EditTimeChart [think of name later]
-----------------------------------

  A tool aimed at programmers and other people who spend a lot of time in their 
  editor (or in other scriptable programs). 

  The idea:

  1. There is a permanently running daemon that logs commands to a file
  2. Scriptable editors contact the daemon on each save/close/whatever.
  3. We can graph our work, without having to do any manual work.
  4. ???
  5. PROFIT (literally!)



Current status » Daemon
-----------------------

  The daemon was written in Python using the Twisted networking library. 
  It logs to a flat plain text file in the following format:

   2009 12 29 10 39 23 1 363 EDIT /home/bspaans/src/file.hs
   YEAR MONTH DAY HOUR MIN SEC DOW DOY COMMAND FILE

  where DOW and DOY resp. stand for the day of the week and year, 
  and where COMMAND is one of EDIT, START or STOP. 

  The program can be found in the daemon/ directory under the name 
  `timechartd' and uses the basicliser library to do most of its 
  heavy lifting.


Current status » Client
-----------------------

  The client is a simple bash script that reads a username and password 
  from a file and contacts the daemon. The edit message can be set using 
  command line arguments. You can find the client in the daemon/ 
  directory. It's currently called `timechart'


Current status » Graphing
-------------------------

  The graphing program is still under heavy development. It is written in 
  Haskell and makes use of the libraries in the Haskell Platform; no other 
  packages are needed. It can currently produce HTML pages, but will also 
  include a command line and interactive mode. 
  
  If you want to have a look at its current (pre-alpha) state, you can compile 
  the program manually with 
    ghc --make Html.hs 

  To produce a HTML report of the log file, you can then run:
    ./Html edittime.log 

  This is all subject to change though.
