Version 1.1:
------------

    * default report(s)

    * a prelude like file, defining the Calendar function
      (to be extended in the future)

    * Some scripts in the scripts/ directory:
        report-to-csv
        report-to-html
        report-to-text
        report-to-xhtml
        report-to-* LOGFILE OUTPUTFILE

    * `titled' keyword in lexer, parser, AST and Query to give 
      results a different title (nice for html and xhtml printers)
    
    * `man' documentation for `report' [DONE]




Future:
-------

    * Find an Haskell-alternative to the daemon and rename report/ to src/

    * Incorporate `chart' library? (currently depends on gtk2hs;
      not that nice of a dependency to have)

    * LaTeX printer

    * Markdown printer
